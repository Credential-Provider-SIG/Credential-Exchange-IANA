1.  Introduction

   The FIDO Alliance’s credential exchange specifications define a
   standard format for transferring all types of credentials in a
   credential manager including passwords, passkeys and more in a manner
   that is secure by default.

   This specification establishes IANA registries for the Credential
   Exchange Format [CredentialExchangeFormat] credential types and
   extension identifiers.  The initial values for these registries are
   in the IANA Considerations section of the [CredentialExchangeFormat]
   specification.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This specification establishes two registries:

   *  The "Credential Exchange Credential Type Identifiers" registry
      (see Section 2.1)

   *  The "Credential Exchange Extension Identifiers" registry (see
      Section 2.2)

   Any additional processes established by the expert(s) after the
   publication of this document will be recorded on the registry web
   page at the discretion of the expert(s).

2.1.  Credential Exchange Format Credential Type Identifier Registry

   Credential Exchange Format credential type identifiers are JSON
   compatible strings defined in "Credential Types Registry"
   (https://fidoalliance.org/specs/cx/cxf-v1.0-ps-20250814.html#sctn-
   iana-credential-types-registry).  Credential type identifiers *MUST*
   be unique across all registered credential type identifiers.

2.1.1.  Registering Credential Type Identifiers

   Credential Exchange Format credential type identifiers are registered
   using the Specification Required policy (see Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126]).

   The "Credential Exchange Format Credential Type Identifiers" registry
   is located at https://www.iana.org/assignments/credential-exchange
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/credential-exchange).

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   Credential type identifier:
      An identifier meeting the requirements given in Section 2.1.

   Description:
      A short description of the credential type.

   Requires an additional payload:
      A "Y" or "N" value indicating whether the credential type requires
      an additional payload outside of the Credential Exchange Format
      JSON document.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the credential
      type.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available, stable
   specification, e.g., as described in Section 4.6 of [RFC8126].  This
   specification MUST include security and privacy considerations
   relevant to the credential type.

2.1.2.  Registration Request Processing

   As noted in Section 2.1.1, Credential Exchange Format credential type
   identifiers are registered using the Specification Required policy.

2.1.3.  Initial Values in the Credential Type Identifiers Registry

   The values listed in the "Credential Types Registry"
   (https://fidoalliance.org/specs/cx/cxf-v1.0-rd-20250313.html#sctn-
   iana-credential-types-registry) section of the
   [CredentialExchangeFormat] specification will be used to populate the
   initial values in the registry.  The Change Controller entry for each
   of those registrations is:

   Change Controller:
      Fido Alliance Technical Working Group (todo: email)

2.2.  Credential Exchange Extension Identifiers Registry

   Credential Exchange Format extension identifiers are JSON compatible
   strings defined in "Extension Registry"
   (https://fidoalliance.org/specs/cx/cxf-v1.0-ps-20250814.html#sctn-
   iana-extension-registry).  Extension identifiers *MUST* be unique
   across all registered extension identifiers.

2.2.1.  Registering Extension Identifiers

   Credential Exchange Format extension identifiers are registered using
   the Specification Required policy (see Section 4.6 of [RFC8126]).

   The "Credential Exchange Format Extension Identifiers" registry is
   located at https://www.iana.org/assignments/credential-exchange
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/credential-exchange).

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   Extension name identifier:
      An identifier meeting the requirements given in Section 2.1.

   Description:
      A short description of the credential type.

   Requires an additional payload:
      A "Y" or "N" value indicating whether the credential type requires
      an additional payload outside of the Credential Exchange Format
      JSON document.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the credential
      type.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available, stable
   specification, e.g., as described in Section 4.6 of [RFC8126].  This
   specification MUST include security and privacy considerations
   relevant to the extension.

2.2.2.  Registration Request Processing

   As noted in Section 2.2.1, Credential Exchange Format extension
   identifiers are registered using the Specification Required policy.

2.2.3.  Initial Values in the Credential Exchange Extension Identifiers
        Registry

   The values listed in the "Extension Registry"
   (https://fidoalliance.org/specs/cx/cxf-v1.0-rd-20250313.html#sctn-
   iana-extension-registry) section of the [CredentialExchangeFormat]
   specification will be used to populate the initial values in the
   registry.  The Change Controller entry for each of those
   registrations is:

   Change Controller:
      Fido Alliance Technical Working Group (todo: email)
